                            you that your vehicle may be worth. “Order” means any agreement between you and us to purchase
                            your vehicle, sell you a particular vehicle or to provide you with any particular products and/or

                            in writing with us. “Associates” means any third parties, whether persons or organisations, with

                            or organisation that has a link to or with our website. “Privacy Policy” means our privacy policy

                            <br> The Terms apply to this website and also include our Privacy Policy. Nothing in the Terms affects

                            <strong>3. WEBSITE USE AND SERVICES AND PRODUCTS</strong>
                            <br>Any Valuation we provide to you or any indicative offers we make are not offers capable of acceptance
                            but will be deemed as invitations to treat. If we supply you with goods or services following
                            an Order then full details of the products and services that we will actually supply to you will
                            be contained in a written agreement, which can only be varied in writing. Any photographs, samples,
                            drawings, specifications, product details in any format or any form of advertising material shown
                            by us to provide some indication of the products and services and are not part of the terms of
                            your Order unless specifically stated within the Order. Nothing on the Website is, or shall be
                            deemed to constitute, financial, investment or other advice. Anything on the Website, including
                            any links to any other websites or information from it or anything whatsoever will not form a
                            recommendation, endorsement, guarantee or warranty and you agree that we have no liability in
                            this regard. Any Order with us is not binding on either party until it has been agreed by execution
                            of a written contract. When you click on links you may be forwarded to third party websites,
                            including those of Associates. We have no control or responsibility regarding third parties,
                            Associates or any other websites. You are aware that you will enter into a separate agreement
                            which has nothing to do with us and you must make yourself aware of the terms of such agreements.
                            You specifically confirm that we cannot be held liable in this regard.
                            <br>

                            <strong>4. OUR OBLIGATIONS</strong>
                            <br> We will provide the use of the website in accordance with the Terms and the Privacy Policy.
                            Whilst we will use our reasonable endeavours to supply the Website and its content, we are not
                            responsible for any failure to provide the Website or any services or any unavailability. The
                            Website is available on an “as is” and “when available” basis. (3) Any right to use the Website
                            is at our sole and absolute discretion. We specifically reserve the right to choose users, including
                            choice by invitation only, and our decisions are absolute.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <strong>5. CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>(1) By using the Website you confirm that you are aged 18 or over, are a resident of the United
                            Kingdom and that you have read and understood and agree to be bound by the Terms. Where you are
                            using the website on behalf of an organisation you confirm that you have the legal right to do
                            so and that the organisation agrees to and permits the use of the Website generally.
                            <br>(2) You agree that use of the Website is for non commercial purposes and that should you breach
                            this condition then you will be liable to pay to us an amount for the use of the Website which
                            you agree will be £100 for each and every such breach of this condition. You agree that this
                            is not a penalty but is a liquidated damages clause. For the avoidance of doubt, each and every
                            page view of the Website, for commercial purposes, will be deemed to be a breach of this condition.
                            <br>(3) You agree to use the Website for its intended and legal purposes and to abide by any and
                            all relevant laws. This includes not using the Website fraudulently, nor using any automated
                            software, process, program, robot, web crawler, spider, data mining, trawling or other ‘screen
                            scraping’ software, process or program.
                            <br>(4) It is your responsibility to:
                            <br> (a) confirm that you have the legal right to use the Website and our services and products;
                            <br>(b) ensure that any product or service meets your needs. We advise that you take independent
                            advice; and
                            <br>(c) supply us with accurate, valid and current information which is free from any defects including
                            but not limited to viruses, spyware, malicious software, trojans, worms, logic bombs and anything
                            else which may have a contaminating, harmful or destructive effect on any part of the Website
                            or the websites of third parties or any other technology.
                            <br> (5) You will be liable for any expenses incurred by us as a result of your failure to comply

                            obtain products and services with those associates then you will be bound by their terms and
                            conditions and it is your sole responsibility to ensure that you understand such terms and conditions
                            before you enter into an agreement with them. We are not responsible or liable for any loss or
                            damage you may suffer or incur in connection with any third party product or service you obtain

                            <br>(3) We will never be liable to you or any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental or
                            consequential loss of profit or any other economic loss or damage whatsoever, whether or not
                            such loss or damage was foreseeable at the date of your use of the Website or the date of the

                            <br> (4) Other than those implied by law where you are dealing as a consumer, in the event of our
                            breaching any of the Terms, your remedies are limited to damages which, in no circumstance whatsoever,
                            will exceed the price of any products or services.
                            <br> (5) We cannot guarantee that the Website or any services provide will be uninterrupted, secure
                            or error-free. We make no warranty against electronic virus, worms or any other defect or problems

                            <strong>12. FORCE MAJEURE</strong>
                            <br> We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any of our obligations if the delay
                            or failure results from events or circumstances outside its reasonable control, including but
                            not limited to acts of God, accidents, war, fire, general strikes, lock outs, failure of any

                            of plant or machinery or shortage or unavailability of raw materials from a natural source of
                            supply, and we shall be entitled to a reasonable extension of our obligations.

                            <br> Each clause or any part at all of the Terms is to be regarded as independent of the others.
                            This means that should any clause or any part of the Terms be found to be unenforceable or invalid
                            it will be severed and will not affect the enforceability or validity of the rest of the Terms.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            are updated on the Website.
