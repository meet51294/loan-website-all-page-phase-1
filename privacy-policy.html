                        <strong>How we collect your personal information</strong>
                        <br> Your information will be collected and processed by Step Chnage during the use of our websites or
                        when you communicate directly with us, such as through e-mail, phone or letter, for example:
                        <br> when you complete our online application form, your details will be stored;
                        <br> if you take out an agreement with us, we will ask that you provide us with documents to support
                        your application, such as proof of address and income. Copies of those documents may be made and
                        retained;
                        <br> during the currency of any agreement with us, we will make notes of any instances of contact between
                        us, which will include any personal information disclosed to us during that contact;
                        <br> any calls made to us or our representatives may be recorded for training and monitoring purposes;
                        and/or
                        <br> after your agreement has been completed, we may keep records of any feedback you give us about the
                        service provided.
                        <br> The type of data collected may include personal information such as your name, address, telephone
                        numbers, e-mail addresses, date of birth and employment details. It may also include details of the
                        agreements you have had with us in the past or unsuccessful applications for further credit. You
                        may also disclose sensitive information to us (such as, information about your physical and mental
                        health, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, sexual life, medical information),
                        which we may hold and process. Wherever possible we will always ask your explicit consent to process
                        this information.
                        <br> You are responsible for providing valid, accurate and up to date information. When you give us information
                        about another individual or organisation it is on the basis that you confirm that they have specifically
                        agreed to this and understand how and why their information will be used.

                        <strong>Data Protection Law</strong>
                        <br> Data Protection Law (which includes the General Data Protection Regulation also referred to as GDPR
                        and Data Protection Act 2018) places obligations on us in relation to the way we handle your personal
                        information. The law permits us to use personal information only if we have a proper reason to do
                        so. The law states we must have one or more of these reasons:
                        <br> To fulfil a contract, we have with you; or
                        <br> when it is our legal duty; or
                        <br> when it is in our legitimate interest; or
                        <br> when you consent to it.
                        <br> A legitimate interest is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information. But
                        even then, it must not unfairly go against what is right and best for you. If we rely on our legitimate
                        interest, we will tell you what that is.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                       
                        <strong>How we use your personal information</strong>
                        <br> Your data will always be dealt with responsibly and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018
                        and GDPR. Information stored or collected about you helps us improve our service and helps to make
                        sure that any agreement you have with us is run smoothly.
                        <br> For example, your information may be used to:

                        <br> carry out business processes such as valuing your vehicle so we can provide or assist you in obtaining
                        such products and services which you require;
                        <br> make credit decisions about you and check the details that you have provided to us are complete

                        <br> administer and manage any application you make to us and, in the event you take out credit with
                        us, to administer your account with us;

                        <strong> How we use your information to make online decisions</strong>
                        <br>
                        <strong> Approving credit</strong>
                        <br> We use a system to decide whether to lend money to you apply for credit. This is called credit scoring.
                        It uses past data to assess how you’re likely to act while paying back any money you borrow. This
                        includes data about accounts you may have had before. Credit scoring will take account of information
                        you provide on your application, information provided by credit reference agencies and information
                        already held on our system. If you submit an application and it is declined through this process,
                        you can contact us within 14 days to have the decision reviewed.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs)</strong>
                        <br>We carry out credit checks when you apply for credit. We may use Credit Reference Agencies to help
                        us with this. Your loan application will be registered on your credit report under the name Step
                        Chnage Limited. We are presently working with Call Credit, Equifax and Perfect Data Solutions Limited
                        (trading as Lending Metrics). We will undertake a search with at least one of the agencies when you
                        apply for credit thereby reviewing your credit records as well as anyone financially associated with
                        you. The agency will keep a record of this search and place a “footprint” on your file, whether or
                        not your application proceeds. Once you take a loan product with us, we will report regularly to
                        the CRAs on your payment history.
                        <br> We will share your personal information with CRAs and they will give us information about you.
                        <br> The data we exchange can include:
                        <br> Name, address and date of birth.
                        <br> Credit application.
                        <br> Details of any shared credit.
                        <br> Financial situation and history.
                        <br> Public information, from sources such as the electoral register and Companies House.
                        <br> We’ll use this data to:
                        <br>
                        <br> Assess whether you are able to afford to make repayments.
                        <br> Make sure what you’ve told us is true and correct.
                        <br> Help detect and prevent financial crime.
                        <br> Manage accounts with us.
                        <br> Trace and recover debts.
                        <br> Make sure that we tell you about relevant offers.
                        <br> Inform you about new services and changes.
                        <br> We will go on sharing your personal information with CRAs for as long as you are a customer. This
                        will include details of your repayments and whether you repay in full and on time. The CRAs may give
                        this information to other organisations that want to check credit status. We will also tell the CRAs
                        when you settle your accounts with us.
                        <br> When we ask CRAs about you, they will note it on your credit file. This is called a credit search.
                        Other lenders may see this and we may see credit searches from other lenders.
                        <br> You can find out more about the CRAs on their websites, in the Credit Reference Agency Information
                        Notice. This includes details about:

                        <strong> Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPAs)</strong>
                        <br> We may need to confirm your identity before we provide products or services to you. Once you have
                        become a customer of ours, we will also share your personal information as needed to help detect
                        fraud and money-laundering risks. We use Fraud Prevention Agencies to help us with this.
                        <br> Both we and fraud prevention agencies can only use your personal information if we have a proper
                        reason to do so. It must be needed either for us to obey the law, or for a ‘legitimate interest’.
                        <br> We will use the information to:
                        <br> Confirm identities
                        <br> Help prevent fraud and money-laundering
                        <br> Fulfil any contracts you have with us.
                        <br> We or an FPA may allow law enforcement agencies to access your personal information. This is to
                        support their duty to detect, investigate, prevent and prosecute crime.
                        <br> FPAs can keep personal information for different lengths of time. They can keep your data for up
                        to six years if they find a risk of fraud or money-laundering.

                        <strong>The information we use </strong>
                        <br> These are some of the kinds of personal information that we use:
                        <br> Name
                        <br> Date of birth
                        <br> Residential address
                        <br> History of where you have lived
                        <br> Contact details, such as email addresses and phone numbers
                        <br> Financial data
                        <br> Employment details
                        <br> Vehicle details
                        <br> Automated decisions for fraud prevention
                        <br> The information we have for you is made up of what you tell us, and data we collect when you use
                        our services, or from third parties we work with.
                        <br> We and FPAs may process your personal information in systems that look for fraud by studying patterns
                        in the data. We may find that an account is being used in ways that fraudsters work. Or we may notice
                        that an account is being used in a way that is unusual for you. Either of these could indicate a
                        possible risk of fraud or money-laundering.
                        <br>

                        <strong>How this can affect you</strong>
                        <br> If we, or a fraud prevention agency, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we
                        may refuse to provide the services or financing you have requested, or to employ you, or we may stop
                        providing existing services to you.

                        <strong>Data transfers out of the EEA</strong>
                        <br> FPAs may send personal information to countries outside the European Economic Area (‘EEA’). When
                        they do, there will be a contract in place to make sure the recipient protects the data to the same
                        standard as the EEA. This may include following international frameworks for making data sharing
                        secure.

                        <strong>Sending data outside of the EEA</strong>

                        <br> Follow your instructions.
                        <br> Comply with a legal duty.
                        <br> If we do transfer information outside of the EEA, we will make sure that it is protected in the
                        same way as if it was being used in the EEA.

                        <strong>If you choose not to give personal information</strong>
                        <br> We may need to collect personal information by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with

                        <strong>Open Banking</strong>
                        <br> This section of our Privacy Policy relates to Open Banking and should be read in conjunction with
                        the other clauses in our Privacy Policy. In the event of conflict with any other clauses, this clause
                        shall prevail.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <strong> What is Open Banking?</strong>
                        <br> Open Banking is the secure way of providing access to your bank or building society account to providers
                        who are registered for this purpose. Registered providers and participating banks and building societies
                        are listed under the Open Banking Directory.
                        <br> Open Banking was set up by the UK Government to encourage more competition and innovation in the
                        financial services sector. As a forward-thinking lender, we support the use of Open Banking as it
                        allows us to process loan applications efficiently, securely and in our customer’s best interests.
                        <br> By permitting access to your bank or building society account information we are able to make a
                        better lending decision as we shall be able to verify your income, outgoings and other matters in
                        order to assess what loan terms would be suitable for you based upon what you can reasonably afford
                        to repay.
                        <br> Further information about Open Banking is available from www.openbanking.org.uk.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <strong>How will my personal data be shared and used for the purposes of Open Banking?</strong>
                        <br> By proceeding with your loan application via our website you expressly consent to us sharing your
                        personal, contact and loan application details (“the Shared Personal Data”) with our registered Open
                        Banking partner, Perfect Data Solutions Limited (“PDS”) who are also a credit reference agency. During
                        your loan application we shall safely and securely direct you to PDS’s secure portal (“the Portal”)
                        for the purposes of granting PDS access to your bank or building society account information (“Transaction
                        Information”). As soon as your Transaction Information is received it shall be reported back to us
                        in the form of a completed search in order that we may continue to process your loan application
                        (“the Permitted Purpose”).
                        <br> Further information about PDS including their registered provider and regulatory status is available
                        from www.lendingmetrics.com.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                       
                        <strong>Is Open Banking secure?</strong>
                        <br> PDS are registered under the Open Banking Directory as an account information service provider and
                        are also regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority as a payment services firm under number 802599.
                        Any data you submit via the Portal will be encrypted and its usage tracked as part of set Open Banking
                        data security standards.
                        <br> We are responsible for the secure transmission of any Shared Personal Data to PDS, for safely directing
                        you to the Portal and for the safe receipt and usage of your Transaction Information.
                        <br> You will not be required to share your banking password or log in details with either us or PDS.
                        Once you have given your explicit consent to share your bank account information on the Portal you
                        will be directed to your own bank or building society’s login page where you will enter in your own
                        login details directly.
                        <br> Save as set out above or elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we are not responsible for your direct
                        data transmissions with PDS or with your own bank or building society.
                        <br> How will my Shared Personal Data and Transaction Information be used?
                        <br> PDS shall, subject to their own terms and conditions and privacy policy, and, if your bank or building
                        society is registered to provide access under the Open Banking Directory, obtain your Transaction
                        Information and submit this back to us for the Permitted Purpose. By way of example, the Transaction
                        Information that we shall receive is likely to include information relating to your income, outgoings
                        and credit worthiness.
                        <br> PDS shall be entitled to re-access your Transaction Information for up to 90 days from the date
                        of your original search result in order to refresh the search results, obtain a snapshot of your
                        data or gather additional data.
                        <br> PDS shall hold the Shared Personal Data and the Transaction Information they receive and retain
                        according to their own terms and conditions and privacy policy, available on the Portal, which you
                        will be required to read and consent to once directed their via our website.
                        <br> As PDS are also a credit reference agency they may also share and keep a record of your Shared Personal
                        Data and Transaction Information.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                       
                        <strong> Will you use my Transaction Information data for any other purpose?</strong>
                        <br> The Transaction Information we receive about you will only be used for the Permitted Purpose. We
                        do not sell or share Transaction Information with any third party. Save as set out above the information
                        contained in the rest of this Privacy Policy deals with how we collate, use, transfer, store, delete
                        and other terms applicable to your personal data including Shared Personal Data and Transaction Information.
                        <br> Do I have to provide you with my consent to proceed?
                        <br> You are not required to provide us with viewing access to your bank account transaction information
                        (Transaction History) or internet banking access details. You may still be allowed to apply for a
                        loan with us if you do not provide us with this information. However, if you do, it will help us
                        make an informed decision about whether we can lend to you.
                        <br> Where your bank or building society have already permitted access to your Transaction Information
                        you shall need to contact them directly in order to withdraw your consent under their particular
                        Open Banking terms and conditions.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                       
                        <strong>Are any of my other rights under this Privacy Policy affected?</strong>
                        <br> Your individual data protection and privacy rights including the right to access, correct, delete,
                        object, restrict, withdraw consent, request transfer and/or make a complaint, continue to apply to
                        relevant personal data we control or process and are dealt with elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
                        <br> Under Open Banking as your personal data is shared by your bank or building society and accessed
                        by PDS you may also be able to exercise your individual data protection and privacy rights against
                        either of them pursuant to their own terms and conditions and privacy policies.
