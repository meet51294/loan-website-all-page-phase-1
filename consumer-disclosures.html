                                            <br> 1.1 The Association represents finance houses, retailers, building societies,
                                            credit-brokers, professional firms, debt collection companies, hire and leasing
                                            companies and others operating in the consumer credit industry.
                                            <br> 1.2 This Code is specific to those members who engage in the use of Bills of
                                            Sale for Consumer Lending regulated under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (‘the
                                            Act’) (as amended from time to time).
                                            <br> 1.3 The purpose of this Code is to ensure compliance by members with the minimum
                                            standards set by the Association, as specified in this Code.
                                            <br> 1.4 The Association and its members shall publicise the existence of this Code
                                            and, where appropriate, provide details of the Complaints Procedure.
                                            <br> 2 MONITORING AND COMPLIANCE
                                            <br> 2.1 The Association, through its Council, shall monitor the compliance of members
                                            with this Code and will require members to submit to Annual Compliance Audits
                                            (ACAs), at the full expense of the individual member, as a condition of membership
                                            of the Association. The Association or any other authorised person(s) will conduct
                                            the ACAs at any of the member’s premises at which the member carries on the relevant
                                            business.
                                            <br> 2.2 Members shall promptly notify the Chief Executive or other officer nominated
                                            by the Council from time to time, of any conduct that comes to their attention
                                            of any member or any other person engaging in Bills of Sale for Consumer Lending,
                                            which is not consistent with this code and which might adversely affect the reputation
                                            of the consumer credit industry in the United Kingdom or of the Association.
                                            <br> 2.3 The Association will record all incidences of reported misconduct, including
                                            misconduct identified through Annual Compliance Audits, and will make those records
                                            available to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
                                            <br> 2.4 The Association, through its Council, may take action against any member
                                            found to be in breach of this Code. Such action may, without limitation, include
                                            unscheduled compliance audits, written warnings, requests for written explanations
                                            and meetings to discuss, and where possible, to resolve the matter.
                                            <br> 2.5 The ultimate sanction, which the Association may impose, is the suspension
                                            or expulsion of a member from the Association. The Association will also promptly
                                            notify the FCA of any members who they suspend or expel and the reasons why.

                                            inappropriate (e.g. because the consumer has indicated that he does not wish

                                            <br> 4.1.4 Members shall not engage in high-pressure selling or other aggressive
                                            sales practices such as pressurising a customer to sign up to a credit agreement
                                            without affording him adequate opportunity to consider the Pre-contract information,

                                            <br> 4.2.2 Where members make available agreements comprising a balloon payment option
                                            representing the full loan amount (also known as the principal), members agree
                                            to make that option available only where their customer is proposing to enter
                                            into the agreement wholly or predominantly for their business purposes (a business
                                            carried on or intended to carry on). Where that is the case, members agree: (a)
                                            to offer both balloon and capital repayment options to the customer and to provide
                                            adequate explanations of the key features and risks of each of the agreement
                                            options in order to place the customer in a position enabling him to assess which
                                            agreement (if any) is adapted to his needs and his financial situation. Freedom
                                            shall be given to the customer to select the payment option that is best suited
                                            to his needs and financial situation; (b) to carry out reasonable specific assessments
                                            of affordability in order to establish from the customer that sufficient funds
                                            will be available by him to repay the loan in a sustainable manner and in full
                                            at the end of the contractual term; (c) that where credit is granted to customer
                                            on the basis of a balloon payment option, the term of the agreement shall not
                                            exceed 12 months. In addition, any subsequent agreement entered into with such
                                            customers, as a result of their inability to pay the final balloon payment on
                                            the earlier agreement, will be repayable by periodical capital and interest repayments
                                            of an amount not greater than the amount of the periodical interest only payments
                                            in the earlier agreement.
                                            <br> 4.3 EXPLANATIONS OF THE CREDIT PRODUCT
                                            <br> 4.3.1 In good time before the customer is bound by any credit agreement or offer,
                                            members shall provide the customer with the Pre-contractual information (PCI)
                                            document by means of the form required by law at that time. Members shall explain
                                            to the customer that they may take away the PCI to consider the terms of the
                                            offer of credit before the making of the agreement and the customer should be
                                            afforded such an opportunity.
                                            <br> 4.3.2 Members shall provide adequate explanations of the credit on offer to
                                            the customer in order to place the customer in a position enabling him to assess
                                            whether the proposed credit agreement is adapted to his needs and to his financial
                                            situation by explaining, but not limited to: (a) the Pre-contractual information
                                            to be provided; (b) the risk, on default of the agreement, that additional interest
                                            and default fees may be charged and the amount or likely amount of such interest/fees;
                                            (c) the risk of losing the asset (usually a vehicle) on which the credit is secured,
                                            how it would be repossessed, and the loss this could entail; (d) that repossession
                                            under the Bill of Sale can take place without a court order and that members
                                            may enter customer’s premises , where reasonably necessary, to take possession
                                            of the vehicle; (e) that repossession can result in significantly higher additional
                                            costs and may not clear all of the debt owed ; and (f) that there is a provision
                                            for voluntary surrender of the asset and the terms and conditions which apply.
                                            <br> 4.3.3 Where a member has clear grounds to suspect that the explanation provided
                                            has not placed the customer in a position to assess whether the agreement is
                                            suited to his needs and his financial situation (e.g. whereby he has not understood
                                            the explanation provided or key aspects of it), members shall provide further
                                            explanation to the customer.
                                            <br> 4.3.4 In all circumstances members should provide the customer with an opportunity
                                            to ask questions about the proposed credit agreement (i.e. before entered into).
                                            Members should also advise the customer how to ask for further information and
                                            explanation about the credit agreement.
                                            <br> 4.4 ASSESSMENT OF AFFORDABILITY
                                            <br> 4.4.1 Members shall, before granting credit or increasing the amount of credit
                                            to be provided to the customer, undertake an assessment of the creditworthiness
                                            of the customer and his ability to undertake the proposed credit commitment,
                                            or specific additional credit commitment, in a sustainable manner, without the
                                            customer incurring financial difficulties and/or experiencing adverse consequences.
                                            Members shall take all reasonable steps in this respect and have special regard
                                            for the requirements prescribed in CONC.
                                            <br> 4.4.2 The assessment of affordability should be based on information and evidence
                                            obtained from: (a) the customer, having provided evidence of his ability to repay
                                            the credit; and (b) a credit reference agency, where necessary.
                                            <br> 4.4.3 Members shall take particular care in relation to applications for credit
                                            from young people in the age range of 18-21 years.
                                            <br> 4.4.4 Members shall continuously monitor their credit granting practices and
                                            procedures and their assessment techniques to ensure that they are prudent and
                                            realistic in the prevailing economic circumstances. They shall not be less rigorous
                                            in assessing the customer’s ability to repay in a sustainable manner by reason
                                            of the fact that a security is offered.
                                            <br> 4.4.5 To the extent that a member may use credit-scoring techniques, members
                                            shall abide by the principles set out in the publication “Guide to Credit Scoring
                                            2000”, as subsequently amended or updated. Where members do not use credit-scoring
                                            techniques they should make it clear to a declined applicant whether or not the
                                            refusal to grant credit relates to a credit reference agency report.
                                            <br> 4.4.6 Members shall ensure that where a customer is refused credit and the customer
                                            believes the refusal to be unreasonable the customer is given the name or title
                                            of a senior official who will review the application.
                                            <br> 4.4.7 Members shall provide appropriate assistance, in the form of information
                                            and guidance, to young (as defined in 4.4.3) and/or vulnerable customers.

                                            with consumers do not contain unfair contract terms.
                                            <br> 4.5.3 Members shall advise customers of the contractual interest rate(s) applicable
                                            to their agreements for credit, the basis on which default interest and charges,
                                            repossession charges and any other charges are calculated and, when they will
                                            be charged.
                                            <br> 4.5.4 Members shall advise customers how any agreed variation of the terms and
                                            conditions of their agreement will be notified and shall give customers at least
                                            14 clear days written notice before any variation takes effect.
                                            <br> 4.5.5 Members shall comply with all statutory and other reasonable requests
                                            by customers for information about their agreements and accounts within 14 days

                                            from the credit agreement without giving any reason, within 14 days beginning
                                            with the relevant day under that section. Where the agreement is an excluded

                                            Tribunal’s (Consumer Credit) decision that agents’ or brokers’ premises do not
                                            necessarily constitute premises at which lenders carry on business (on a temporary
                                            basis) for the purposes of section 48(2)(a) and/or section 67(1)(b)(i) of the

                                            with customers whose accounts fall into arrears. Those policies and procedures

                                            collection procedures and in particular shall not engage in any unfair or improper
                                            business practices identified in CONC or other FCA sourcebooks.
                                            <br> 4.8.2 Members shall ensure, by reviewing annually their debt collection procedures
                                            and those of any third parties they employ, that they conform to high ethical
                                            standards and allow for proper consideration of the customer’s circumstances
                                            and in particular: (a) encourage customers in financial difficulties to inform
                                            them of their difficulties at the earliest possible moment (and members will
                                            endeavour to respond sympathetically, without prejudice to members’ rights);
                                            (b) provide in all relevant correspondence the name or title of a specially trained
                                            member of staff who may be contacted if difficulties arise; and (c) take into
                                            consideration, before determining whether to enforce an agreement, all information
                                            supplied by the customer or otherwise in relation to the cause of any default
                                            and the customer’s future ability to repay in a sustainable manner. If the customer
                                            has disclosed multiple debt problems, members shall inform the customer of the
                                            availability of free impartial debt advisory services.
                                            <br> 4.8.3 Members should suspend the pursuit of recovery of a debt from a borrower,
                                            under circumstances in which notification has been given and/or it is reasonably
                                            believed that the borrower lacks the mental capacity to make relevant financial
                                            decisions regarding the management of his debt at that time, unless or until
                                            a reasonable period of time has been allowed for relevant evidence to be provided
                                            as to the likely impact of the capacity problem on the borrower’s ability to
                                            manage his debt and deal with a debt recovery business. The appropriate means
                                            of collecting evidence, in appropriate circumstances, could be to use the standard
                                            Debt and Mental Health Evidence Form (DMHEF), developed between MALG and the

                                            are in arrears unless the nature of and likely amount of those charges are disclosed

                                            complaints. Members shall establish a complaints procedure and furnish information
                                            on request about their complaints procedure. Customers shall be told what further
                                            steps are available if they believe that the complaint has not dealt with satisfactorily.
                                            These steps include the complaint being referred to a senior manager of the member,
                                            to the CCTA and the ultimate resort of the unresolved complaint being referred
                                            to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). 8.2 CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS The following

                                            or an agreement with a member, the Association shall, in the first instance,
                                            refer the complaint to a senior executive of the member, for consideration.

                                            (through an appropriate representative) shall endeavour to conciliate between
                                            the customer and the member to restore communication between the customer and
                                            the member where communications have broken down. The Association shall accept,
                                            for conciliation, complaints made against members and subsidiary companies of

                                            be advised of their right to seek resolution through the Financial Ombudsman
                                            Service. 8.2.4 Nothing in this Code restricts or is intended to restrict the

                                            Financial Ombudsman Service.

                                            has already been considered under a dispute resolution scheme of other relevant
                                            Codes of Practice or of the Financial Ombudsman Service or where the complaint
                                            has been the subject of a judicial decision.
                                            <br> 8.2.6 Members shall notify customers of their complaints procedure, including
                                            the customer’s right to seek resolution of the complaint under the Conciliation
                                            Scheme and the Financial Ombudsman Service.

                                            The following is written in plain English to explain what this means for you. However, this information sheet is not a comprehensive guide and independent legal advice should be obtained if you are unsure of your rights or liabilities under a bill of sale. This document is provided as guidance to you and does not form, or amend, any loan agreement we enter into with you.<br><br>
                                           <strong> What is a Bill of Sale?</strong><br>
                                           A Bill of Sale is what gives us our security over your vehicle. This means that:<br>

                                            * Until you have repaid your loan we are technically the legal owner of your vehicle. However, you can still keep driving it and once you have paid off your loan the ownership goes back to you.<br>
                                            * The Bill of Sale will be registered with the High Court in London and the register is open to public inspection.<br>
                                            * If you default on the payment of your loan, or other terms within the loan agreement, we will have the right to serve a Default Notice on you under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. If you do not make good the default, within the time stated in the notice, we will be entitled to take possession of your vehicle and sell it. You should note that we do not need a court order to repossess your vehicle.<br>
                                            * If your vehicle is repossessed and sold for an amount of money that is insufficient to pay off the money you owe us you will still have to pay the shortfall. The sale of the vehicle does not put an end to the loan.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            <strong>Step Change Limited</strong>
                                            <br><br>
                                            What can you expect from us? We will:<br>

                                            * Lend responsibly and treat our customers fairly and with due consideration.<br>
                                            * If we apply charges to your account we will only do so where such charges are reasonable and to recover costs we have incurred.<br>
                                            * If you have a material change of circumstances we will take this into consideration and may agree to reduce your repayments until such time as you are able to continue with your original contractual repayments.<br>
                                            * If you have a complaint we will take it seriously and deal with it properly and promptly.<br>
                                            * Until we have terminated the loan agreement you may return the vehicle to us in full settlement of the debt to us, provided that instructions have not already been issued to an authorised person to recover the vehicle and you act in good faith and the vehicle has not been maliciously damaged.<br>
                                            * We will only repossess a vehicle after we have taken reasonable steps to obtain contractual payments from you by other means. If we do repossess your vehicle we will provide you with a 14 day period in which to repay the debt and re-purchase it or we may reach an alternative suitable agreement with you. If we do have to sell the vehicle we will endeavour to obtain the best price for it. If the vehicle is sold for an amount more than you owe then we will pay the excess amount to you. Repossession is an expensive process. If we are forced to recover the vehicle on which your loan is secured significant extra costs may be added to your account.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            What do we expect from you? We require that you:<br>

                                            * Make your payments on time and in the right amount.<br>
                                            * If your circumstances change you should contact us immediately to discuss any problems that you may have with keeping your payments up to date.<br>
                                            * We expect you to look after and maintain the vehicle to the same condition (subject to reasonable wear and tear) as it is now (i.e. at the time you borrow from us), and keep the vehicle insured in accordance with our agreement with you, until you have repaid all amounts due to us, unless we agree to waive these requirements.<br>
                                            * We require that you don’t sell your vehicle until you have settled your loan in full.<br>
